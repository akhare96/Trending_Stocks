# TrendingStocks

This app scrapes a list of the current trending stocks on Reddit for the past 24 hours.  The user selects a stock and further details are displayed.  The user then has a choice to view news,
ratings, or select a next stock.  The program keeps running until the user types "exit" at any point.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'trending_stocks'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install trending_stocks

## Usage

## Development

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
